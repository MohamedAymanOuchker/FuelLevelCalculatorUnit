# FuelLevelCalculatorUnit

This project involves developing a fuel level calculation unit (FLCU) for an aircraft system. The aim is to design software that processes data from capacitive and temperature sensors to accurately calculate the amount of fuel in the tanks. The main tasks include receiving the data, calculating the permittivity and density of the fuel, validating the data, and communicating the results via a CAN bus. The project aims to provide reliable fuel estimation, essential for safe and efficient flight operations.

## Objectives

The aim of this project is to develop a Fuel Level Calculation Unit (FLCU) for an aircraft system, capable of accurately measuring and calculating the amount of fuel in the tanks. This includes:

- Process sensor data (capacitive and temperature) to determine fuel height and density.

- Calculate permittivity and fuel mass using specific algorithms.

- Validate data to ensure reliability, using default values in case of missing or invalid data.

- Communicate results (fuel quantity in kg and lbs) to the aircraft system.
